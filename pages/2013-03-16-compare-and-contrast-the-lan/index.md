description: "LAN – A local area network is a computer network covering a local area, like a home, office, or group of buildings in close proximity to each other. Current LANs are most likely to be based on switched IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, or on Wi-Fi technology running at 10, 100 or 1000 Mbps."

LAN – A local area network is a computer network covering a local area, like a home, office, or group of buildings in close proximity to each other. Current LANs are most likely to be based on switched IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, or on Wi-Fi technology running at 10, 100 or 1000 Mbps.

In general a local area network is made up of devices in local proximity to each other and has finite distance limitions. The LAN can be either wired or wireless but is only at a single location.

WAN – A wide area network is a computer network covering a broad geographical area. Like any network whose communications links cross metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries over a long distance. The largest and most well-known example of a WAN is the Internet.

A wide area network is comprised of multiple LANs connected to each other across distances. The method of interconnection is handled via a third-party carrier.

Both network types have some similarities. First of all, LAN and WAN use the same basic protocols for communication. Second, Both of them involve two or more nodes. Third, They can both be used in small geographical areas, although, WAN can go further ranging from towns to countries. What’s more, the connectivity can be switches and routers via telephone lines or fiber optic.

To create a LAN ,workstations and printers are connected to a switch or router using Ethernet cables or Wifi . The switch or router uses algorithms to detect the best path to channel data packets out of each node. The cables used to connect the workstations to switches can be coaxial, copper or fiber. Computer accessories such as printers can be shared by workstations in the same LAN. Therefore, each LAN in a WAN will need a separate set of hardware resources such as switches and routers.

A WAN is an interconnected system of LANs, therefore, the WAN link is between each LAN. To create a WAN, extra hardware such as a router is needed along with a communication link, which is provided by communication service provider. A router is needed to route packets. The communication links is used as a carrier of these data packets to the destination of LAN. The communication links used to connect two WAN points together are either a single point-to-point leased lines or parts of shared entities packet-switching or circuit-switching.

A value added network (VAN) is a private network, provided by a third party, for exchanging information through a high-capacity connection. This network supports large organizations who are engaging in business. A third party is hired to facilitate electronic data interchange (EDI). This is an easy way to move data from one company to another. With the online companies prefer to move data over the internet, because it is cheaper rather than paying monthly fees and per character fees. For example, if you purchase something online, you are able to pick it up at the nearest store. Through this network the store knows what was ordered online and will have it ready for pick up.

A virtual private network (VPN) is the extension of a private network that encompasses links across shared or public networks like the Internet. A VPN enables you to send data between two computers across a shared or public internetwork in a manner that emulates the properties of a point-to-point private link. The act of configuring and creating a virtual private network is known as virtual private networking.

A VAN (value added network), is essentially a proprietary network over which EDI, EFTPOS or other financial transactions are implemented. While a VPN is more of a protocol to remotely connect your computer to another network and make it appear as if you are part of the local setup, while providing encryption to that link. Large, popular organization use value added networks as well as virtual private network (VPN) to integrate their online stores with their physical stores.
