Nowadays, it seems that MIS is playing an increasingly important role in business. In business company, no matter what type industry you’re in , no mater what size of the company, every one need to communicate and collaborate with each other. Every company would like to control cost and gain the maximum benefit for every dollar spent. So the company need a collaboration package to improve its productivity with better group work.

One technology the company should consider of is cloud computing, which helps businesses save time and money. First, Cloud-based programs can be used at any time on almost any device with an Internet connection, which lead to a greater collaboration. Secondly, cloud-based services can help companies save money, including the server maintenance, power and cooling costs, and hardware and software expenses. Additionally, it has secure data backup and greater reliability. If one don’t have time or resource to implement a backup strategy, one can choose a cloud-based service to back up your data frequently and automatically.

There are mainly two choices of the collaboration packages based on cloud computing. One is Microsoft Office 365, which is ideal for elaborate enterprise needs, and the SharePoint Online may be used to create custom applications. The other is Google apps, which include Gmail, one of the best email clients, and since it evolved from the customer market, it is simpler and cheaper. Both of them include a word processing, presentation, and spreadsheet software, and only need web brouser to use. To sum up, I would choose Google Apps, which open oneline collaboration to the masses, but Office 365 can be complex for some users.
