Efforts to automate and improve business processes have been undertaken for over half a century. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) emerged as a solution in the late 1990s. The purpose of ERP is to integrate all business functions and to facilitate the flow of information under a suite of software applications. Wiki provides a generalized definition of “ERP” as “Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems integrate internal and external management of information across an entire organization – embracing finance/accounting, manufacturing, sales and service, customer relationship management, etc.” Some of the well-known ERP vendors include SAP, Oracle and Epicor.

An ERP offers several benefits including increased efficiency, productivity and reduced costs, risks, etc. First of all, an ERP can enhance the work efficiency of a whole organization. An ERP software attempts to integrate business processes across departments into a single enterprise-wide information system , so that it improve the collaboration across functional departments and increase efficiencies of doing business.

Secondly, one of the most immediate benefits of implementing an ERP is reduced operating costs, such as lower inventory control cost, lower production costs, lower marketing cost and lower help desk support costs. By avoiding duplication of information but not reinventing the wheel for common business processes, and ERP provides opportunities for cost reduction, which is leading to increased margins.

Thirdly, Because an ERP integrate all business functions, it can help greatly improve an organization’s performance. The ability of ERP system that provides the same updated and accurate information across different business functions is so valuable to enterprises.

Let’s take an example of a customer order to understand this better: Before the advent of ERP, once a customer order was created, it had to follow a paper trail from department to departments. This manual process may cause errors and delays; till the order was entered into the application of a particular department, the goods could not be manufactured or shipped.

With an ERP system, a customer order is entered only once, and this information is available to all the applications across different functions. Then the order will be handled separately by different departments soon. This shortens lead time, reduces the overall cost of manufacturing, and ensures enhanced customer satisfaction.

But what constitutes an ERP implementation failure? According to research collected by IT cortex, more than 50% of companies surveyed who implemented ERP systems stated that the project failed to meet their expectations. These implementation failures are a result of continued inabilities of organizations to fully prepare for the three critical implementations:

First, few ERP solutions are one-size-fits-all. The projects begin with the assumption that a one-size-fits-all ERP package will meet all of the needs of the enterprise, without actually validating that assumption. For instance, the Military Sealift Command (MSC) successfully implemented Oracle’s ERP solution. They find an ERP package that mirrors their business practices as closely as possible, then resolve to implement the package without significant modifications

Secondly, many organizations fail to dedicate sufficient resources to an ERP implementation. The organization fail to demonstrate and deploy capabilities in changes the business processes until so late the correction in the project becomes problematic. Not only should everyone in the organization be trained on how to do business differently, they are trained on new computer software.

Thirdly, there is employee’s resistance to change. An ERP’s one-size-fits-all functionality often brings many company operations to a halt, or create creates additional burdens, thereby losing effectiveness and employee confidence. At Purina Mills, the company contracted with a third party consultant to conduct the training, but users complained almost immediately that they needed a translator to help them understand the training. Finally, they fired the third party trainers and developed the training course internally.

In conclusion, there are as many benefits of ERP implementations as there as many causes of failed projects. Performance measures must be developed and standardized to give organizations a clearer picture of the benefits derived from Enterprise Resource Planning implementation.
