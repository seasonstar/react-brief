Nowadays, it seems that MIS is playing an increasingly important role in business. In business school, MIS is likely to be the single best course to teach you key skills which IT professionals need. Students not only learn to solve business problems with computers using programs, but also master the critical skills in one’s career.

The first fundamental concepts I’ve learnt is Moore’s Law, which indicates that the cost of data communications and data storage is essentially zero, but does not mean a profesional should care about how fast a computer a company can buy for $100. Like Facebook and Twitter, they control huge data in the Internet, and one business company can post or collect contents via applications on them. Essentially, total cost to companies is zero.

One of the marketable skills in one’s career is non-routine cognitive skills. first of non-routine skills is abstract reasoning, which is the ability to make and manipulate models. The second one is systems thinking, which is the ability to model the components of the system, to connect the inputs and outputs among those components into a sensible whole. Then, the activity of two or more people working together to achieve a common goal, result or work product is called collaboration. Finally, the ability to experiment is making a reasoned analysis of an opportunities, envisioning potential solutions, evaluating those possibilities and developing the most promising ones, consistent with the available resources. Respectively, In the FlexTime case, Jennifer should be able to model the event life cycle, get a clear perspective of how vendors providing collateral material for events, willing to work with others, and so on.

Marc Andreessen illustrates that in many industries—without the need to invest in new infrastructure and train new employees. In 2000, the cost of a customer running a basic Internet application was approximately $150,000 a month. Running that same application today in Amazon's cloud costs about $1,500 a month.
